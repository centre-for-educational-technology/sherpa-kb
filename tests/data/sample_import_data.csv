General,Why should I use Selfie,"SELFIE is a free, online tool to help schools understand how they use digital technologies for learning. With SELFIE, schools can take a snapshot of where they stand in their use of digital technologies, taking on board views of teachers, students and school leaders. This self-assessment process can help start a dialogue within the school on potential areas for improvement. SELFIE also allows a school to monitor its progress over time"
